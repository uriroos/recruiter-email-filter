# recruiter-email-filter
A list of email domains of tech recruiters and agencies that you can use to filter your email inbox.

## Background of the list
As an engineer, you have 3 problems in life:

1. You're out of coffee
2. Legacy code (hey, it could be your own code of last week)
3. Recruiters.

This repo won't fix all of your problems, but it will filter out messages of recruiters. Do with it what you want: Auto-delete the messages, auto-reply with a bot that tells them what you are looking for or prioritize them in your inbox.

### Do you hate recruiters?
No, I certainly don't hate them. We even work with a selected few (yes, yes, this makes me also part of the problem). However, my mailbox tends to explode if I don't filter their drip campaigns out of my inbox. 

As a famous programmer once said: "If every recruiter learned to code we wouldn't have this problem". -TL

## Implementing the list
No automatic NPM install/extensions here (yet) unfortunately. 

### Gmail (web)
1. Go to settings (cog wheel at the right top)
2. Hit the `All settings` button
3. Hit the `Filters and blocked addresses` tab
4. Tap on `Import filter`
5. Select the [gmail-mark-as-read-and-archive.xml](uriroos/recruiter-email-filter/clients-filters/gmail-mark-as-read-and-archive.xml) file

## Pull requests
Have more domains to add to the list? Want to add filters for other e-mail clients? Did you add an extension or do you have any other ideas? I am open for pull requests that add more recruiter filter awesomeness. **Just be aware to never include a full address or share any Personally Identifiable Information.**
