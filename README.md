# recruiter-email-filter
A list of domains of tech recruiters that you can use to filter your email inbox.

## Background of the list
As an engineer you have 3 problems in live:

1. You're out of coffee
2. Legacy code (hey it could be your own code of last week)
3. Recruiters.

This repo won't fix all of your problems, but it will filter out messages of recruiters. Do with it what you want: Auto-delete the messages, auto-reply with a bot that tells them your ask, prioritize them in your inbox.

## Implementing the list
No NPM install/extensions here (yet) unfortunatly. 

### Gmail (web)
1. Go to settings (cog wheel at the right top)
2. Hit the `All settings` button
3. Hit the `Filters and blocked addresses` tab
4. Hit `Import filter`
5. Choose the file from this repo

## Pull requests
I'm inviting everyone to share any recruiter domains that are not part of the list. 

**Please don't share any Personally Identifiable Information.**
